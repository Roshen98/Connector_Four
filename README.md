# Connector_Four

A basic implementation to the game of connector four with the use of two dimensional arrays.
The AI's choice is randomized. Users need to choose what symbol they want to use and if they want to go first or the AI goes first.
Wherever the user chooses, the piece will be dropped in the respective column if that column is valid and not full.
It is a fixed board with a standard 6X7 Connector Four Game Board
